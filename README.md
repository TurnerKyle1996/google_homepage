# google_homepage
Hello, this is my very first programming project!
The project was to make a webpage that looks like the Google.com homepage from scratch
I was able to develop several basic but important skills using HTML and CSS, and browser developer tools.
The most challenging part of this project was the small, but very noticable, positioning of elements in the header and footer.
My solution to this was using flexbox, the flex-grow rule, and adding padding to the child elements. 
Thank You for checking out my project!
